# Real-Time Event Processing & Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project implements a real-time, event-driven data pipeline that ingests high-volume events, processes them using streaming logic, stores aggregated metrics, and provides observability through monitoring and dashboards.

## Architecture (High-Level)
- Event Producers generate structured events
- Apache Kafka acts as the ingestion and buffering layer
- Stream processing aggregates events in near real time
- Aggregated metrics are stored in an analytical database
- Prometheus monitors system health
- Grafana visualizes both system and business metrics
- The system is deployable on cloud infrastructure

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- Processing: Apache Spark (Structured Streaming)
- Storage: SQL Database
- Monitoring: Prometheus
- Dashboards: Grafana
- Containerization: Docker
- Cloud: (Future deployment)

## Project Status
- Layer 0: Project foundation – In Progress
